				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Hello, my name is Eros Yuan, and I'm currently a junior in AGPM. I have a deep passion for 3D
					modeling and painting, which fuels my creative pursuits. Besides these artistic interests, I am an
					avid gamer.
					One of my all-time favorite games is 'Elden Ring' by Hidetaka Miyazaki, which has greatly inspired
					me.
					My ultimate dream is to develop my own game alongside my friends, combining our skills and passions
					to create something unique and exciting.
