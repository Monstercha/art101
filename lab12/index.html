					<h2>challenge</h2>
					<p>One significant challenge I faced during this lab was understanding and implementing the concept
						of conditionals in JavaScript effectively. The task required creating a function called
						sortingHat that assigns Hogwarts houses based on the length of a given name. Initially, grasping
						the modulus operator and how it could be used to cycle through house assignments was confusing.
						I spent considerable time reading through the documentation and experimenting with different
						implementations to ensure I understood how modulus could produce values that correctly map to
						each house.

				<div id="problems">
					<h2>problems</h2>
					<p>there was an issue with linking the JavaScript file correctly from the HTML file. Despite
						following the instructions, the script was not loading initially, leading to a lot of trial and
						error to identify the root cause. Another problem encountered was managing the JavaScript
						console errors effectively. The error messages were sometimes vague, requiring additional
						research to decode and solve them.
					</p>

				<div id="reflection">
					<h2>reflection</h2>
					<p> Focusing first on getting the HTML structure right before moving on to JavaScript allowed for a
						clearer understanding of how each component interacts. Moreover, this lab reinforced the
						importance of debugging skills. Using the JavaScript console for logging variable states and
						error messages was crucial in identifying where things were going wrong. </p>
