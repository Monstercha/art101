			<h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<div id="challenge">
					<h2>challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this week was centered around implementing loops effectively in our JavaScript code.
						The task required us to create a webpage that utilizes various types of loops to manipulate and
						display data dynamically. Understanding the differences about if loops
						and applying them correctly in different scenarios was initially challenging. I spent a
						considerable amount of time experimenting with different loop structures to ensure they
						performed the desired operations efficiently and correctly.

					<h2>problems</h2>
					<p>One significant problem I encountered was debugging nested loops. As part of the lab, we were
						required to create more complex data manipulations which often involved multiple layers of
						loops. These nested loops occasionally led to logic errors that were difficult to trace and fix.
					</p>

					<h2>reflection</h2>
					<p> We opted to append new DOM elements for each number rather than concatenating strings. This
						approach made it easier to apply consistent styling and improved the readability of the results.
						By using jQuery to create and append paragraph elements to the output div, we achieved a clean
						and organized display.
