					<p>One of the primary challenges I faced was handling JSON data. Initially, I struggled with parsing
						the JSON data correctly. To overcome this, I reviewed lecture notes and experimented with
						JSON.stringify() to understand how data was structured. This iterative process helped me become
						more comfortable with manipulating JSON data.

					<h2>problems</h2>
					<p>Testing various API endpoints in the browser revealed some inconsistencies. Not all APIs
						responded as expected, and parsing the JSON data correctly required careful attention to the API
						documentation. For example, the response formats differed slightly between APIs, causing some
						confusion.

					<p> The AJAX lab was an excellent hands-on experience that deepened my understanding of asynchronous
						web requests and data handling. Working with real-world APIs provided insight into common issues
						developers face, such as data parsing and error handling.</p>
