					<p>One of the primary challenges we faced was understanding the fundamentals of JSON and APIs.
						Initially, the concept of how JSON is used for data interchange and how APIs facilitate
						communication between different software systems was difficult to grasp.

					<p>The major problem was integrating APIs into our projects. Despite understanding the theoretical
