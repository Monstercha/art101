			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<p>The idea of this lab is to learn how to download files from GitHub and manage them efficiently on your
				local system. During the experiment, special attention was paid to the download location, search and
				organization methods of files.</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>When I initially downloaded from Github, I did not specify a location to save the file, causing the
					file to be saved in the default download folder and difficult to find directly. This requires using
					the search function in Finder to locate the file. As well as the file being a template, I need to
					manually organize the file to make it easier to access and manage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>After organizing and restructuring the files, I created a well-ordered file system on my local drive
					where each file is properly categorized and named. This has greatly improved my work efficiency and
					sped up file retrieval.</p>
