				<ul>
					<li>Gather your ingredients and tools: You will need chicken breast, oranges, ginger, garlic,
						cilantro,
						soy sauce, sugar, white vinegar, cornstarch, salt, pepper, cooking oil, a wok, knife, cutting
						board,
						bowls, and a spoon.</li>
					<li>Prepare the chicken: Clean the chicken breast and cut it into small pieces. In a bowl, add a
						pinch
						of salt, some pepper, and a big spoonful of cornstarch. Toss the chicken pieces in the bowl
						until
						they are evenly coated.</li>
					<li>Make the batter: In another bowl, mix a sufficient amount of cornstarch with a bit of water to
						form a paste.</li>
					<li>Mix the orange sauce: In a small bowl, combine fresh orange juice, soy sauce, sugar, white
						vinegar,
						and a teaspoon of cornstarch. Stir it all together and set it aside.</li>
					<li>Cook the chicken: Pour enough cooking oil into a wok and heat it to about 340 degrees
						Fahrenheit.
						Dip the chicken pieces in the batter and fry them until they are golden brown.</li>
					<li>Saute the seasonings: Keep some oil in the wok, add finely chopped garlic and ginger, and fry
						until
						fragrant.</li>
					<li>Add the orange sauce: Pour the orange sauce mixture into the wok and cook on medium heat until
						the
						sauce thickens.</li>
					<li>Add the chicken: Toss the fried chicken pieces into the wok and stir quickly to coat them evenly
						with the orange sauce.</li>
					<li>Serve: Dish out the orange chicken and sprinkle some cilantro on top.</li>
					<li>Enjoy.</li>

				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge I'm facing is that I don't know how to write pseudocode. I've only ever eaten Orange
					Chicken but never made it myself. I tried to imagine how to make it by looking at how other Chinese
					dishes are prepared.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>The problem I'm facing is that it's my first time using JavaScript, and I'm not sure how to add an
					`if` statement. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I think this assignment is a brand-new challenge for me. JavaScript is more complex compared to HTML
					and CSS. I put a lot of effort into completing the pseudocode, and in the end, I did my best to
					finish the code. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The result turned out pretty good, I finished it and got the formatting all sorted out.</p>
