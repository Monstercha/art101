			<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>One of the challenges I ran into was correctly writing the code to declare a variable userName and
					use window.prompt() to get the user name. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>When the JavaScript function didn't show the expected results initially, requiring some debugging. I
					had to use console.log() a lot to track what was happening with the variables and to really
					understand the data flow.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Working with my partner really highlighted how valuable it is to share ideas and problem-solving
					strategies, which made debugging a lot smoother and led to some creative solutions. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>I successfully completed Lab 7</p>
