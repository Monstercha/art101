			<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge in Lab 8 was to integrate various elements of web development including HTML, CSS, and
					JavaScript to create a structured webpage. The task involved setting up a proper folder structure,
					linking JavaScript and CSS files correctly, and experimenting with JavaScript's map() function to
					perform operations on array elements using both named and anonymous functions. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>Implementing the map() function with both named and anonymous functions required a clear
					understanding of how callbacks work. Debugging was necessary to get the correct outputs in the
					console.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Working with my partner really highlighted how valuable it is to share ideas and problem-solving
					strategies, which made debugging a lot smoother and led to some creative solutions. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>I successfully completed Lab 8</p>
			</div>

			<div class=output>
				<h3>Script Output</h3>
				<p>My array: [1, ,2 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]</p>
				<p>Result:[7, ,8 ,9 ,10 ,11, 12, 13]</p>
				<p>doubled array result:[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. 14]</p>
